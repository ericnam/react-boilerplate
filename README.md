This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but has custom babel and webpack configurations.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Webpack bundles all React .js/.jsx components into bundle.js, with a corresponding html page.

### `npm run serv`

This initiates the webpack-dev-server but also utilizes nodemon to reload on file change. I would use this script for development.
